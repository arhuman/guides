## Open Source

Open source software is any type of software that is available to the public to see or to be downloaded for free. Anyone is capable of creating a open source project.

Open source projects are legally made open through a creative license. They are changed, maintained or abandoned by their creators at any time. Many open source projects have contributors that volunteer to add and edit code.
